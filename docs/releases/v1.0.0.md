# Release v1.0.0: First Public Release

**Date:** 2026-02-02

## Overview
This marks the first stable public release of the Yupay Synthetic Data Generator. Moving out of the beta phase, this version introduces robust internationalization, architectural decoupling, and production-ready dependency management.

## Key Features

### Internationalization (I18N)
- Added full support for English and Spanish locales.
- Locale detection based on system settings or configuration defaults.

### Architecture Improvements

### Core Enhancements
- **MemoryGuard:** Production-grade RAM protection system that throttles or aborts generation if memory usage exceeds safe limits.
- **Entropy Engine:** Deterministic chaos injection system (Nulls, Orphans, Noise) to simulate dirty enterprise data.
- **Performance:** optimized batch processing for large datasets (>5M rows).

## Changelog
- **Changed:** Refactored project structure to `src-layout`.
- **Changed:** Aligned `duckdb` and `click` versions with production standards.
- **Added:** User Manual and Architecture Documentation.
- **Fixed:** Circular imports in sales domain logic.
