# Release v1.1.0: Deep Realism & Volatility

**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Overview
The v1.1.0 update focuses on transforming the data generation from a static simulation to a dynamic, organic, and realistic representation of business activity. This release introduces advanced temporal patterns, customer behavior modeling, and global non-determinism.

## Key Features

### 1. Organic Seasonality (Cosine Waves)
Replaced discrete monthly logic with continuous mathematical waves.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Seasonality factors now flow daily rather than jumping at month boundaries.
- **Yearly Phase Shifts:** Each year has a +/- 15-day random shift in seasonal peaks, preventing identical year-over-year patterns.

### 2. Deep Volatility Engine
Introduced multi-layer volatility to simulate real-world chaos:
- **Macro-Volatility:** Annual economic health factors (0.85x - 1.15x).
- **Payday Effects:** 25% volume spikes on typical salary payment dates (14th-16th, 28th-31st).
- **Weekend Bias:** 15% general consumption increase on Saturdays and Sundays.
- **Daily Jitter:** Randomized +/- 20% noise on daily transaction volumes.

### 3. Advanced Customer Behavior (multimodal)
- **Pareto Principle (80/20):** Implemented skewed distribution where 20% of customers (VIPs) generate 80% of the orders.
- **Product Preferences:** "Summer" tagged products (e.g., alcohol, BBQ) now have a 20% higher probability of being purchased on weekends.

### 4. Global Randomness
- **Dynamic Seeding:** If no seed is provided, the system now generates a time-based seed, ensuring every run produces unique datasets.
- **Price Variance:** Transaction prices now include a +/- 5% random fluctuation to simulate discounts or dynamic pricing.

## UX Improvements
- **Clean Output:** Removed debug logs and consolidated summary tables.
- **Size Reporting:** The CLI summary now includes the actual physical size of the generated dataset on disk.

## Upgrade Notes
- No breaking changes to configuration schema.
- Output distribution will change significantly from v1.0.0 (more variance, less uniform).
