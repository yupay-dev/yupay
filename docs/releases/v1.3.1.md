# Release v1.3.1: Seasonality Refinements (Ramp-ups)

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** Stable

## Overview
This patch release refines the seasonality logic to include **Event Ramp-ups**, replacing unrealistic single-day spikes with gradual demand curves.

## Key Features
*   **Event Ramp-ups**:
    *   **Christmas**: Gradual increase starting Nov 20th.
    *   **Mother's Day**: Ramp-up starting 1 week prior.
    *   **Fiestas Patrias**: Increase starting Jul 15th (Gratificaciones).
*   **Cyber Days**: Extended to 3-day events in July and November.

## Impact
*   **Realistic Growth**: Jan->Nov growth now visible (~30%) due to pre-Christmas ramp.
*   **Smoother Curves**: Demand limits abrupt shocks, mimicking real consumer behavior.
